<h2 id="概述">概述</h2>

<p>由于身体或技术上的限制，你的访客也许无法以像你期望的方式体验网站。本文中，我们给出了可访问性的一般原则，并解释了其中的一些规则。</p>

<h3 id="可访问性_一般原则">可访问性：一般原则</h3>

<p>We might associate accessibility at first with negative limitations. This building has to be accessible, so it must follow these regulations for door width and toilet size and elevator placement.</p>

<p>That's a narrow way to think of accessibility. Think of it as a wonderful way to empower people and serve more customers. What can the people in Brazil do with your English website? Can the people with smartphones browse a heavy, cluttered website designed for a large desktop monitor and unlimited bandwidth? They'll go somewhere else. In general, <em>we must think about our product from the viewpoints of all our target customers, and adapt accordingly. </em>Hence accessibility.</p>

<h3 id="Web可访问性">Web 可访问性</h3>

<p>In the specific context of the web, accessibility means that anyone can benefit from your content, regardless of disability, location, technical limitations, or other circumstances.</p>

<p>Let's consider video:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>听力障碍</dt>
 <dd>How does a hearing-impaired person benefit from a video? You have to provide subtitles —or even better, a full text transcript.</dd>
 <dd>Also, make sure people can adjust the volume to accommodate their unique needs.</dd>
 <dt>视觉障碍</dt>
 <dd>Again, provide a text transcript that a user can consult without needing to play the video, and an audio-description (an off-screen voice that describes what is happening in the video).</dd>
 <dt>暂停功能</dt>
 <dd>Users may have trouble understanding someone in a video. Let them pause the video to read the subtitles or process the information.</dd>
 <dt>键盘功能</dt>
 <dd>Let the user tab into/out of a video, play it, and pause it without being trapped in it.</dd>
</dl>

<h4 id="Web可访问性基础">Web 可访问性基础</h4>

<p>A few necessities for basic Web accessibility include:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Whenever your site needs an image to convey meaning, include text as an alternative for visually-challenged users or those with slow connections.</li>
 <li>Make sure all users can operate graphical interfaces (like unfolding menus) solely with a keyboard (e.g., with Tab and the Return key).</li>
 <li>Provide an attribute explicitly specifying your content's language, so that screen readers read your text properly.</li>
 <li>Make sure that a user can navigate to all widgets on a page solely with the keyboard, without getting trapped. (At least let them Tab in and out.)</li>
</ul>

<p>而这只是个开始。</p>

<h3 id="可访问性的拥护者">可访问性的拥护者</h3>

<p>Since 1999, the {{Glossary("W3C")}} has operated a working group called the {{Glossary("WAI","Web Accessibility Initiative")}} (WAI) promoting accessibility through guidelines, support material, and international resources.</p>

<p>Accessibility can impact both a website's design and technical structure.</p>

 <li>From a design point of view, we suggest learning about <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Design_for_all_types_of_users_101">designing for all types of users</a>.</li>
 <li>If the technical side interests you more, you could learn how to <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Using_images">embed images in webpages</a>.</li>
