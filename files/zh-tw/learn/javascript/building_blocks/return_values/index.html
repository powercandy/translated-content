<p>我們將在本課程中討論最後一個基本概念，即關閉函數 - 回傳值。 有些函數在完成後沒有回傳重要值，但其他函數會，並且了解它們的值是什麼，如何在代碼中使用它們以及如何使自己的自定義函數返回有用值非常重要。 我們將在下面介紹所有這些內容。</p>

<h2 id="What_are_return_values">What are return values?</h2>

<p><strong>Return values</strong> are just what they sound like — values returned by the function when it completes. You've already met return values a number of times, although you may not have thought about them explicitly. Let's return to some familiar code:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var myText = 'I am a string';
var newString = myText.replace('string', 'sausage');
console.log(newString);
// the replace() string function takes a string,
// replaces one substring with another, and returns
// a new string with the replacement made</pre>

<p>We saw exactly this block of code in our first function article. We are invoking the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace">replace()</a> function on the <code>myText</code> string, and passing it two parameters — the substring to find, and the substring to replace it with. When this function completes (finishes running), it returns a value, which is a new string with the replacement made. In the code above, we are saving this return value as the value of the <code>newString</code> variable.</p>

<p>If you look at the replace function MDN reference page, you'll see a section called <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace#Return_value">Return value</a>. It is very useful to know and understand what values are returned by functions, so we try to include this information wherever possible.</p>

<p>Some functions don't return a return value as such (in our reference pages, the return value is listed as <code>void</code> or <code>undefined</code> in such cases). For example, in the <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/javascript/building-blocks/functions/function-stage-4.html#L50">displayMessage() function</a> we built in the previous article, no specific value is returned as a result of the function being invoked. It just makes a box appear somewhere on the screen — that's it!</p>

<p>Generally, a return value is used where the function is an intermediate step in a calculation of some kind. You want to get to a final result, which involves some values. Those values need to be calculated by a function, which then returns the results so they can be used in the next stage of the calculation.</p>

<h3 id="Using_return_values_in_your_own_functions">Using return values in your own functions</h3>

<p>To return a value from a custom function, you need to use ... wait for it ... the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return">return</a> keyword. We saw this in action recently in our <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/javascript/building-blocks/loops/random-canvas-circles.html">random-canvas-circles.html</a> example. Our <code>draw()</code> function draws 100 random circles somewhere on an HTML {{htmlelement("canvas")}}:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function draw() {
  ctx.clearRect(0,0,WIDTH,HEIGHT);
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(255,0,0,0.5)';
    ctx.arc(random(WIDTH), random(HEIGHT), random(50), 0, 2 * Math.PI);
    ctx.fill();
  }
}</pre>

<p>Inside each loop iteration, three calls are made to the <code>random()</code> function, to generate a random value for the current circle's x coordinate, y coordinate, and radius, respectively. The <code>random()</code> function takes one parameter — a whole number — and it returns a whole random number between 0 and that number. It looks like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function randomNumber(number) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random()*number);
}</pre>

<p>This could be written as follows:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function randomNumber(number) {
  var result = Math.floor(Math.random()*number);
  return result;
}</pre>

<p>But the first version is quicker to write, and more compact.</p>

<p>We are returning the result of the calculation <code>Math.floor(Math.random()*number)</code> each time the function is called. This return value appears at the point the function was called, and the code continues. So for example, if we ran the following line:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">ctx.arc(random(WIDTH), random(HEIGHT), random(50), 0, 2 * Math.PI);</pre>

<p>and the three <code>random()</code> calls returned the values 500, 200, and 35, respectively, the line would actually be run as if it were this:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">ctx.arc(500, 200, 35, 0, 2 * Math.PI);</pre>

<p>The function calls on the line are run first and their return values substituted for the function calls, before the line itself is then executed.</p>

<h2 id="Active_learning_our_own_return_value_function">Active learning: our own return value function</h2>

<p>Let's have a go at writing our own functions featuring return values.</p>

<ol>
 <li>First of all, make a local copy of the <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/javascript/building-blocks/functions/function-library.html">function-library.html</a> file from GitHub. This is a simple HTML page containing a text {{htmlelement("input")}} field and a paragraph. There's also a {{htmlelement("script")}} element in which we have stored a reference to both HTML elements in two variables. This little page will allow you to enter a number into the text box, and display different numbers related to it in the paragraph below.</li>
 <li>Let's add some useful functions to this <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element. Below the existing two lines of JavaScript, add the following function definitions:
  <pre class="brush: js">function squared(num) {
  return num * num;
}

function cubed(num) {
  return num * num * num;
}

function factorial(num) {
  var x = num;
  while (x &gt; 1) {
    num *= x-1;
    x--;
  }
  return num;
}</pre>
  The <code>squared()</code> and <code>cubed()</code> functions are fairly obvious — they return the square or cube of the number given as a parameter. The <code>factorial()</code> function returns the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial">factorial</a> of the given number.</li>
 <li>Next, we're going to include a way to print out information about the number entered into the text input. Enter the following event handler below the existing functions:
  <pre class="brush: js">input.onchange = function() {
  var num = input.value;
  if (isNaN(num)) {
    para.textContent = 'You need to enter a number!';
  } else {
    para.textContent = num + ' squared is ' + squared(num) + '. ' +
                       num + ' cubed is ' + cubed(num) + '. ' +
                       num + ' factorial is ' + factorial(num) + '.';
  }
}</pre>

  <p>Here we are creating an <code>onchange</code> event handler that runs whenever the change event fires on the text input — that is, when a new value is entered into the text input, and submitted (enter a value then press tab for example). When this anonymous function runs, the existing value entered into the input is stored in the <code>num</code> variable.</p>

  <p>Next, we do a conditional test — if the entered value is not a number, we print an error message into the paragraph. The test looks at whether the expression <code>isNaN(num)</code> returns true. We use the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/isNaN">isNaN()</a> function to test whether the num value is not a number — if so, it returns <code>true</code>, and if not, <code>false</code>.</p>

  <p>If the test returns <code>false</code>, the <code>num</code> value is a number, so we print out a sentence inside the paragraph element stating what the square, cube, and factorial of the number are. The sentence calls the <code>squared()</code>, <code>cubed()</code>, and <code>factorial()</code> functions to get the required values.</p>
 </li>
 <li>Save your code, load it in a browser, and try it out.</li>
</ol>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you have trouble getting the example to work, feel free to check your code against the <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/javascript/building-blocks/functions/function-library-finished.html">finished version on GitHub</a> (<a href="http://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/building-blocks/functions/function-library-finished.html">see it running live</a> also), or ask us for help.</p>
</div>

<p>At this point, we'd like you to have a go at writing out a couple of functions of your own and adding them to the library. How about the square or cube root of the number, or the circumference of a circle with a radius of length <code>num</code>?</p>

<p>This exercise has brought up a couple of important points besides being a study on how to use the <code>return</code> statement. In addition, we have:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Looked at another example of writing error handling into our functions. It is generally a good idea to check that any necessary parameters have been provided, and in the right datatype, and if they are optional, that some kind of default value is provided to allow for that. This way, your program will be less likely to throw errors.</li>
 <li>Thought about the idea of creating a function library. As you go further into your programming career, you'll start to do the same kinds of things over and over again. It is a good idea to start keeping your own library of utility functions that you use very often — you can then copy them over to your new code, or even just apply it to any HTML pages where you need it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So there we have it — functions are fun, very useful and, although there's a lot to talk about in regards to their syntax and functionality, fairly understandable given the right articles to study.</p>
